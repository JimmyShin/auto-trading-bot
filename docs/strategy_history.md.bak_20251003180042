# Strategy History

## 2025-? : Donchian + ATR Prototype
- Combined Donchian channel breakouts with ATR-based filtering and risk controls.
- Produced sparse signals and stalled live testing cadence.
- Retained engine scaffolding for state management and risk orchestration.

## 2025-? : MA Cross Downgrade (Current Default)
- Temporarily shifted to a 5/20 moving-average cross to restore signal frequency.
- Strategy is now registered as `ma_cross_5_20` and wired through the strategy registry.
- Registry allows swapping strategies via the `STRATEGY_NAME` config/ENV without touching the main loop.

## Roadmap
- Re-introduce Donchian+ATR as `donchian_atr` strategy once signal density improves.
- Coexistence handled by the registry; both strategies can be toggled per environment.
- Future work: share risk pipeline while allowing bespoke entry logic per strategy module.
