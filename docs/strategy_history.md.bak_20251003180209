# Strategy History

## Sep 2025 — Donchian + ATR Prototype
- Combined Donchian channel breakouts with ATR-based filtering and risk controls.
- Produced sparse signals in forward tests, which slowed feedback loops and regression coverage.
- Kept the engine scaffolding for risk coordination and state persistence.

## Oct 2025 — MA Cross Downgrade (Current Default)
- Downgraded to a 5/20 moving-average cross to regain signal cadence while keeping risk rules stable.
- Registered as `ma_cross_5_20` within the strategy registry and loaded by default via `STRATEGY_NAME`.
- Registry lets operators override the active strategy through configuration or environment variables without touching the main loop.

## Roadmap
- Re-introduce the Donchian+ATR logic as `donchian_atr` once signal density targets are hit.
- Maintain co-existence by sharing the risk engine while isolating entry logic per strategy module.
- Expand tests to cover strategy selection paths and regression baselines for each plugin.
